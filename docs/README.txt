WhiteboardModel: disconnectFromServer() was tested manually by:
					connecting to an instance of WhiteboardServer from another computer
					closing client window and ensuring that the correct message was sent by using a print statement
					ensuring that client was removed from usersbar of those connected
					ensuring that a new user could use that disconnected user's username
					
Manual Tests:
 - When the client connected to the server successfully:
 	- the correct WelcomeImage.bmp was loaded onto their canvas
 	- the GUI's BottumButtonBar was updated correctly, as specified in the design document
 	- the server accepted the client connection, and waited for user input (tested via print statements)
 - When the client entered a username and desired whiteboard and submitted this choice:
  	- the server received the correct "whiteboard ..." message (tested via print statements)
  	- in the case where the username was already in use by another client
  		- a "usernameTaken" message was generated by the server (again, via print statements)
  		- the client received that message
  		- the GUI's BottomButtonBar does not change
  		- the correct UsernameTakenImage.bmp was loaded onto their canvas
  		- this behaviour was repeatable after this stage (input of a taken username again produced the behaviour described above)
  		- connectedToWhiteboard remained false
  	- in the case where the username was unique
  		- a new Client object was added to the user's chosen whiteboard's clients list
  		- the WhiteboardServer's usernames list was updated with the new client's chosen username
  		- a new Thread of a ClientHandler instance was created
  		- connectedToWhiteboard was set to true
  		- the client's GUI's BottomButtonBar updates by removing the field for username input 
		- the client's GUI now displays the user's chosen whiteboard
  - Once the client was connected to a whiteboard successfully
  	- their name showed up in the usersBar at the right side of the GUI
  	- in the case of connected to an already populated whiteboad, the other users' usernames were also displayed
  	- when the client draws a line, WhiteboardModel gets a request to send a "line ... " message to the server
