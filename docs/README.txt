Collaborative Whiteboard

This software allows users to set up a server hosting several Windows Paint look-like "whiteboard", 
and spawn clients that can connect to said server simultaneously and draw on it. 

It also allows users to connect to a non-local server hosted by some other user of this same software.

To begin the server, run WhiteboardServer.java
To then begin a client, run WhiteboardGUI.java

All interaction with this software takes place in the GUI.  Upon opening the GUI, one can specify the IP Address and Port number of the server to connect to, and then click the "Connect" button to attempt to connect.  If this is a valid IP and Port, then the user will be connnected and prompted to enter a username, pick a board, join, and begin using their chosen interactive whiteboard!

Enjoy,
