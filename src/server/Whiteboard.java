 * Whiteboard represents a whiteboard on the server.  We will have an instance of this class for every whiteboard we have on

 * When clients interact with this whiteboard and change it (connecting/disconnnecting/drawing/erasing), this whiteboard will
 * be updated to reflect the changes and stored in a list of whiteboards on the server side.
 * 
 * TESTING:
 *  all public methods are run through base tests in WhiteboardTest.java
 *  to fully test the Whiteboard class, we used manual tests

/* ---------------------------------------------------Thread safety argument--------------------------------------------------------------/
 * Methods which mutate clients (addClient; removeClient) or interact with the clients in clients (sendMessageToAll) must acquire a lock
 * on clients. Additionally, usersMessage is only called within addClient, which must acquire a lock on clients. 
 * This monitor pattern prevents any possible race conditions on our clients list. 
 * 
 * The only methods accessing history are the mutator addLine and the observer loadWhiteboard. Both of these must acquire a lock on 
 * history, thus preventing any possible race conditions.
 *   
 * Whiteboard's fields are private, final, and accessed only by methods within this class. Thus, according to the above assertions, 
 * Whiteboard is threadsafe.
